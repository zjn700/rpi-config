- added bin directory to the $HOME directory and moved my one shell script there. Dropped the .sh extension. Updated .bashrc to include the bin directory. It's configured in the .profile file, but apparently that file is not being read. :/
- changed time zone from EST to Singapore
- changed batteries on my cheap bluetooth keyboard
- bluetooth wasn't in the Vim spell check list, so I added it (zg)]

- cleaned the fridge today, but not the freezer.
- kinda tired at this moment. May be a consequence of the lower carb diet.
