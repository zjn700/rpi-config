# Test the Royal Kludge keyboard 

## This time on the rpi4 via VNC 

So far so good. No real issues. The cursor keys work fine, although they did
not on the AWS Workspace. :/

The Pi will be my primary dev device while at home. I'll keep the AWS Workspace
up-to-date for when I need a mobile device. Although, the pi is still in play
there as well. Just haven't tested it the Argon40/SSD version yet. Maybe later
today.
